Developing a robust and secure authentication system is paramount to manage distinct user roles within the application. The system will enforce access restrictions, ensuring that each role is granted appropriate permissions. The defined roles and their corresponding functionalities are:

Manager Role:

Create, update, and delete employee profiles.
Manage restaurant tables, including creation and deletion.
Maintain the restaurant menu by adding, updating, or removing items.
Receptionist Role:

Display available tables and facilitate table bookings.
View occupied tables, including average waiting time calculations.
Server Role:

Take customer orders.
Notify the kitchen when a table has been served.
Generate and manage invoices for completed orders.
Receive notifications for table bookings and order readiness.
Chef Role:

Access a comprehensive list of orders received from servers.
Mark orders as prepared once completed.
This authentication system will ensure that each user is assigned the appropriate role, allowing them access only to the functionalities relevant to their responsibilities. It enhances security by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive features and data. The implementation will involve secure authentication mechanisms, role-based access control (RBAC), and robust session management to guarantee a seamless and controlled user experience.
